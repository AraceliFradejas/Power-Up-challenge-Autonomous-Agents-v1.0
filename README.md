## 🤖Briefing  Power-Up Challenge – Autonomous Agents v1.0

This project was built as part of the **Autonomous Agents Final Challenge** in the Microsoft Power Up program.

I chose Scenario A – **New Hire Welcome**, where the goal is to design an autonomous system that detects new employees in a database and automatically welcomes them via email or Teams, assigning an onboarding buddy as needed.
